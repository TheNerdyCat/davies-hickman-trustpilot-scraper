## 3.0 Setup
You will need to install and set up a pipenv environment for the project. Make sure that your Jupyter Notebook kernel is also using this pipenv environment. After installing the necessary packages in the Pipfile, the two notebooks will be able to run out-of-the-box, there shouldn't be any adjustments to the code.

## 4.0 Analysis and Outputs
An output slide deck has been included in the repository. Any analysis is included in the [notebooks](https://github.com/TheNerdyCat/davies-hickman-trustpilot-scraper/blob/main/notebooks/trustpilot_scraper_results_analysis.ipynb) directory.
