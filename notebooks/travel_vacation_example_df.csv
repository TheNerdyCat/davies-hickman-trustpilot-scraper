369,P&O Cruises,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/pocruises.com,2.7,1966,3,united kingdom,True,2023-07-25,2,"Expected a luxurious holiday, experienced less than mediocre. This was our 5th Cruise, having only cruised with Royal Caribbean before. We expected great things from our Amsterdam Cruise on Ventura. However, the experience has left us deflated and not wanting to cruise with P&O again. The price certainly did not reflect the experience. Embarkment onto the cruise was swift and organised, thanks to ABP. Once we were on board and no longer being shepherded by ABP staff, good organisation went out the window. Disembarking and embarking the ship when at the host port of Amsterdam was awful, with queues of around 20 minutes in both directions. Our first place to visit on board was the pool deck, with our 17 month old. I asked 4 members of staff which pool we could enter with the little one (as she isn’t toilet trained). We were told there were two available for her; one on deck 15 in the solarium and one on deck 16 behind ""the Reef"". The pool on in the solarium was far too cold for a baby (and most guests as no-one was in during our time on deck). We went to find the “splash pool” on deck 16, which 3 staff couldn’t direct us to - which isn’t surprising as it could only be accessed by walking through the buffet and then up a set of stairs (bearing in mind this is a small pool for babies/toddlers so we were using a pram, which we had to kart up and down the stairs) once we arrived the pool was out of action for maintenance. Meaning no usable pool for our little one. When we could access our room, there was no cot bed, which our house keeping member of staff tried to rectify promptly. However, after three tries of bringing different travel cots to the room, the staff member left us with a half functioning cot (the sides wouldn’t clip in - so collapsed easily) as he didn’t have access to another. The food in the buffet was bland and tasteless, compounded by the fact that there were only a few choices for meal options. Not a patch on the offerings on a Royal Caribbean cruise. The main menu food in the Main Dining Room was a little better. However, the portion sizes were laughable. One evening, we had lamb koftas to start. 2 koftas arrived, smaller than cocktail sausages. Also, the children’s menu was terrible - the sausages & chicken nuggets were dry, tough, and hard (presumably re-heated). The only choice that seemed freshly cooked was the fish fingers. Suffice to say, we actually lost weight whilst on what should be an “all-inclusive” holiday. On the final day, the ship had a complete power failure. This happened whilst I was walking the corridors (which turned pitch black with no emergency lighting - which was very scary). After a few minutes, emergency lighting came on. However, there was no other power to the boat. I navigated back to the room as we had not been told anything by staff even though I had passed 2 members on the corridor who were as surprised as me. It was only after 5-10 minutes that we heard from the bridge with a slighy reassuring message. I struggle with anxiety at times, and this caused me to suffer a considerable episode.Staff seemed to have been instructed to be distant with guests, and we rarely had a genuine interaction with staff on board. Generally speaking, people interact more with young children. This was certainly not the case with most staff on board (there was a single exception, Neseraj, an assistant waiter, was brilliant on the one night he was waiting on us). I'm quite certain that this isn't natural behaviour. Hence, it seems that staff have been specifically instructed to avoid having friendly interactions with guests. The ""my time"" dining option was woefully organised. Early in the cruise, the entertainment manager announced that it wasn't possible to book tables when on the ""my time"" dining option and that guests should simply arrive at their chosen meal venue whenever they wanted and would be seated by hosts if a table was available. Should there be no tables immediately available, guests would be handed pagers to allow them to continue their evening without waiting in a queue for the evening meal. Whilst this sounds good in practice, we had to wait as long as an hour, every night, having been issued pagers. We tried arriving at different times & both restaurants but experienced exactly the same result. The intimation is that you would not have to queue, were you paying for the 'premium' restaurants (of which there are more than the included main dining areas) on board, despite having already paid a significant sum to be on board. Would not recommend P&O Cruises to anyone and certainly won't be cruising with them again.",19,True,"expected a luxurious holiday, experienced less than mediocre. this was our 5th cruise, having only cruised with royal caribbean before. we expected great things from our amsterdam cruise on ventura. however, the experience has left us deflated and not wanting to cruise with p&o again. the price certainly did not reflect the experience. embarkment onto the cruise was swift and organised, thanks to abp. once we were on board and no longer being shepherded by abp staff, good organisation went out the window. disembarking and embarking the ship when at the host port of amsterdam was awful, with queues of around 20 minutes in both directions. our first place to visit on board was the pool deck, with our 17 month old. i asked 4 members of staff which pool we could enter with the little one (as she isn’t toilet trained). we were told there were two available for her; one on deck 15 in the solarium and one on deck 16 behind ""the reef"". the pool on in the solarium was far too cold for a baby (and most guests as no-one was in during our time on deck). we went to find the “splash pool” on deck 16, which 3 staff couldn’t direct us to - which isn’t surprising as it could only be accessed by walking through the buffet and then up a set of stairs (bearing in mind this is a small pool for babies/toddlers so we were using a pram, which we had to kart up and down the stairs) once we arrived the pool was out of action for maintenance. meaning no usable pool for our little one. when we could access our room, there was no cot bed, which our house keeping member of staff tried to rectify promptly. however, after three tries of bringing different travel cots to the room, the staff member left us with a half functioning cot (the sides wouldn’t clip in - so collapsed easily) as he didn’t have access to another. the food in the buffet was bland and tasteless, compounded by the fact that there were only a few choices for meal options. not a patch on the offerings on a royal caribbean cruise. the main menu food in the main dining room was a little better. however, the portion sizes were laughable. one evening, we had lamb koftas to start. 2 koftas arrived, smaller than cocktail sausages. also, the children’s menu was terrible - the sausages & chicken nuggets were dry, tough, and hard (presumably re-heated). the only choice that seemed freshly cooked was the fish fingers. suffice to say, we actually lost weight whilst on what should be an “all-inclusive” holiday. on the final day, the ship had a complete power failure. this happened whilst i was walking the corridors (which turned pitch black with no emergency lighting - which was very scary). after a few minutes, emergency lighting came on. however, there was no other power to the boat. i navigated back to the room as we had not been told anything by staff even though i had passed 2 members on the corridor who were as surprised as me. it was only after 5-10 minutes that we heard from the bridge with a slighy reassuring message. i struggle with anxiety at times, and this caused me to suffer a considerable episode.staff seemed to have been instructed to be distant with guests, and we rarely had a genuine interaction with staff on board. generally speaking, people interact more with young children. this was certainly not the case with most staff on board (there was a single exception, neseraj, an assistant waiter, was brilliant on the one night he was waiting on us). i'm quite certain that this isn't natural behaviour. hence, it seems that staff have been specifically instructed to avoid having friendly interactions with guests. the ""my time"" dining option was woefully organised. early in the cruise, the entertainment manager announced that it wasn't possible to book tables when on the ""my time"" dining option and that guests should simply arrive at their chosen meal venue whenever they wanted and would be seated by hosts if a table was available. should there be no tables immediately available, guests would be handed pagers to allow them to continue their evening without waiting in a queue for the evening meal. whilst this sounds good in practice, we had to wait as long as an hour, every night, having been issued pagers. we tried arriving at different times & both restaurants but experienced exactly the same result. the intimation is that you would not have to queue, were you paying for the 'premium' restaurants (of which there are more than the included main dining areas) on board, despite having already paid a significant sum to be on board. would not recommend p&o cruises to anyone and certainly won't be cruising with them again.",united kingdom

399,P&O Cruises,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/pocruises.com,2.7,1966,3,united kingdom,True,2023-07-24,1,"UPDATE: Following my review, P&O left me a comment below, asking me to contact their customer support. I did show and received an automatic email confirming their receipt of my message, but warning me the response time was 14 days - so well after my cruise would have been over. Now it is exactly one month after I messaged them, and I still have had no reply. Please do not be convinced by the speediness of their social media team that this represents their customer service. A month to respond to a complaint is insanity.—Original review:I’ve not even left yet and I’m dreading going. I’ve had to submit two written complaints already and spent countless hours on phones.I’m supposed to be celebrating my last big family holiday with “children” as my oldest has turned 18 and is moving out. It’s also my tenth wedding anniversary and I wanted to visit Lisbon.Booked a year ago, give or take and immediately enquired about celebrating on board with vow renewal. Sold out. Ok, no problem, we don’t need to do that.Want to book trains early; don’t get told boarding times until 21 days before cruise, when all fares are increased. Either have to pay the increase, spend an absolute fortune on local accommodation, or arrive super early and potentially sit around Southampton for hours. Boarding ended up at almost 2pm, so good job we didn’t pick that one.Want to book the younger kids into kids clubs. We’re a large family, split over four cabins. Can’t book until 15 days before sailing date, for unexplained, probably arbitrary reason. I book the second the clubs become available. All but one are fine; there’s an error on one of the forms, it’s different to the rest. You don’t need to be an IT expert to know when a system has a bug, but luckily I am one anyway.Phone up; after I get past the AI “assistant” who is somehow even less useful than the normal call screening garbage, I get to a rude person who informs me that they can’t book in kids clubs over the phone (but they can book in packages that you need to pay extra for, of course). Despite taking over 90 minutes to connect to a human, the response I get is “sometimes it’s not available until 14 days, try again tomorrow”. I point out that the others were fine, but I try to be a good sport about it.Obviously doesn’t work, call up again, long waiting again, call handler is nice but can’t help. Pushes the problem to a supervisor who replies rudely “we can’t book them in, they need to do it on the boat”. Yeah, great, except YOU have a big in YOUR system which will stop ME from getting what I paid for. Formal complaint leads to a phone back several days later with no warning, meaning I’m at work and don’t see it. A second missed call and I realise that if I’m ever going to speak to them, I’ll need to call myself a third time. Eventually get through, I get given a form to fill in and hand into the boat for kids club. So, essentially useless, saving me maybe 5 minutes on the boat. Brilliant. No apologies, barely an acknowledgement that there’s a problem - even after I send them the screenshots and details they need to fix it. It’s not MY job as a customer to fix YOUR problem.I’m not going to let that get me down though; I at least get to go on my multiple thousand pound holiday, right? Ah, no, today, less than a week before I set sail, I get told there’s an event in Lisbon and now we’re going to some random place in Spain instead. Look it up; this even has been in the books for years. There’s people talking about it being here since way before they advertised the cruise to me. So P&O knew it was happening, but sold me the cruise anyway. They decided to tell us when it’s too late to book an alternative or change dates.In case it’s not clear: P&O SOLD CRUISES TO DESTINATIONS IT KNEW IT WOULD NEVER ARRIVE IN.As far as I’m concerned this is either criminal behaviour or criminally incompetent. Either way, I don’t exactly feel safe stepping foot on board. Of course not a single penny has been offered to try and make amends when by rights they should be offering me a full refund. But regulation and governments are pathetic and toothless and let this legalised criminality carry on.Save yourself a lot of stress and time. I wish I’d looked at this site before I booked. NEVER book with this group of charlatans. I’m going to spend the rest of my day going through insurance documents and speaking to Citizens Advice, while comforting my crying children. I suspect I’ll end up thousands of pounds out of pocket. NEVER AGAIN.—Post-review updateThe cruise ultimately missed another destination as well, arriving at only 50% of the stated itinerary. We were told that the cruise line would do nothing to support passengers for this, that it was our responsibility to claim on insurance. They said they would email us a confirmation needed to make that claim- they obviously never have",20,True,"update: following my review, p&o left me a comment below, asking me to contact their customer support. i did show and received an automatic email confirming their receipt of my message, but warning me the response time was 14 days - so well after my cruise would have been over. now it is exactly one month after i messaged them, and i still have had no reply. please do not be convinced by the speediness of their social media team that this represents their customer service. a month to respond to a complaint is insanity.—original review:i’ve not even left yet and i’m dreading going. i’ve had to submit two written complaints already and spent countless hours on phones.i’m supposed to be celebrating my last big family holiday with “children” as my oldest has turned 18 and is moving out. it’s also my tenth wedding anniversary and i wanted to visit lisbon.booked a year ago, give or take and immediately enquired about celebrating on board with vow renewal. sold out. ok, no problem, we don’t need to do that.want to book trains early; don’t get told boarding times until 21 days before cruise, when all fares are increased. either have to pay the increase, spend an absolute fortune on local accommodation, or arrive super early and potentially sit around southampton for hours. boarding ended up at almost 2pm, so good job we didn’t pick that one.want to book the younger kids into kids clubs. we’re a large family, split over four cabins. can’t book until 15 days before sailing date, for unexplained, probably arbitrary reason. i book the second the clubs become available. all but one are fine; there’s an error on one of the forms, it’s different to the rest. you don’t need to be an it expert to know when a system has a bug, but luckily i am one anyway.phone up; after i get past the ai “assistant” who is somehow even less useful than the normal call screening garbage, i get to a rude person who informs me that they can’t book in kids clubs over the phone (but they can book in packages that you need to pay extra for, of course). despite taking over 90 minutes to connect to a human, the response i get is “sometimes it’s not available until 14 days, try again tomorrow”. i point out that the others were fine, but i try to be a good sport about it.obviously doesn’t work, call up again, long waiting again, call handler is nice but can’t help. pushes the problem to a supervisor who replies rudely “we can’t book them in, they need to do it on the boat”. yeah, great, except you have a big in your system which will stop me from getting what i paid for. formal complaint leads to a phone back several days later with no warning, meaning i’m at work and don’t see it. a second missed call and i realise that if i’m ever going to speak to them, i’ll need to call myself a third time. eventually get through, i get given a form to fill in and hand into the boat for kids club. so, essentially useless, saving me maybe 5 minutes on the boat. brilliant. no apologies, barely an acknowledgement that there’s a problem - even after i send them the screenshots and details they need to fix it. it’s not my job as a customer to fix your problem.i’m not going to let that get me down though; i at least get to go on my multiple thousand pound holiday, right? ah, no, today, less than a week before i set sail, i get told there’s an event in lisbon and now we’re going to some random place in spain instead. look it up; this even has been in the books for years. there’s people talking about it being here since way before they advertised the cruise to me. so p&o knew it was happening, but sold me the cruise anyway. they decided to tell us when it’s too late to book an alternative or change dates.in case it’s not clear: p&o sold cruises to destinations it knew it would never arrive in.as far as i’m concerned this is either criminal behaviour or criminally incompetent. either way, i don’t exactly feel safe stepping foot on board. of course not a single penny has been offered to try and make amends when by rights they should be offering me a full refund. but regulation and governments are pathetic and toothless and let this legalised criminality carry on.save yourself a lot of stress and time. i wish i’d looked at this site before i booked. never book with this group of charlatans. i’m going to spend the rest of my day going through insurance documents and speaking to citizens advice, while comforting my crying children. i suspect i’ll end up thousands of pounds out of pocket. never again.—post-review updatethe cruise ultimately missed another destination as well, arriving at only 50% of the stated itinerary. we were told that the cruise line would do nothing to support passengers for this, that it was our responsibility to claim on insurance. they said they would email us a confirmation needed to make that claim- they obviously never have",united kingdom

I included a request for car parking at the port in Southampton at a cost of £80 to be deducted from the onboard spending account. I thought no more about it until May 4th when I realised I’d not received any confirmation of the parking arrangements so I telephoned P&O and was told categorically that there was no record of my booking a parking space on their system and I must be mistaken. I’m 83years old and my memory is not great so I assumed I might have messed up the online application so spent some hours on the phone arranging a last minute alternative which was very stressful but turned out well in the end. However when I received my final invoice for onboard spending I found that that the £80 parking charge had still been retained by the company. I complained to P&O through their website and some weeks later received an email refusing to consider any refund as the fault was entirely mine. They invented some pretext that I had changed the ter of the booking (no information whatsoever when and how) and that the onus was on me to have contacted the car park directly (no explanation as to how with no contact details).

515,P&O Cruises,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/pocruises.com,2.7,1966,3,united kingdom,True,2023-06-11,2,"Just returned from a 14 night Mediterranean cruise on Arvia, P&Os new flagship.Let’s start with some positives. It is a brand new ship, very tastefully decorated, the public spaces bars etc are very nice as is the deck space and most facilities.The cabins are very nice and fulfil their purpose to a reasonably high standard.Now the negatives. The ship is simply too big with too many people served by too few staff and as a result the standards of service and quality take a massive nosedive. It seemed that we had unwittingly booked a themed cruise and the theme was Queuing, because this was the case for almost everything bar the use of the toilet in your cabin. By far and away the biggest complaint and seemingly a constant topic of conversation throughout the ship is the absolute shambles that is dining and the ridiculously useless app based booking system for everythingI make these observations based on the height the bar is set at by P&O in all its advertising so they set the expected standards on which to be judged.Let’s start with the so called Freedom Dining, where one can supposedly choose exactly when and where you wish to eat by using the My Holiday app. This should be called In Your Dreams Dining All restaurants are fully booked either days in advance, in some cases the whole cruise, or within minutes of the ‘virtual queue’ opening. No sample menus are available for most of the restaurants, there is no information as to the level of cover charges imposed at non inclusive restaurants and as there are no sample menus you cannot see the additional charges for certain dishes.Our first few nights of Freedom Dining experienceWe joined the virtual queue for Zenith at 6.40pm and there were 79 other people ahead of us. At 7.45pm we receive a notification message via the ‘My Holiday’ app, that our table is ready. You then  have 15 minutes to get to the restaurant. We get there after ten and there were about 60 other people queuing outside the Zenith restaurant all holding their phones which are telling them their tables are also ready. (There was a separate queue for walk ins with about 30 people in that. We then had to wait another 20 minutes to get seated by which time the queue behind us was the same size as it was when we joined it. When we got seated there were empty tables all around waiting to be cleared. They remained like that for the next 20 mins. One couple who had been waiting outside for over an hour stormed in and sat at a table that had been left uncleared and, quite rightly, demand to be served! It seems similar things were going on in different parts of this restaurant and also the Meridian restaurant below, as the senior restaurant staff were huddled together in heated discussion.When our food eventually arrived it resembles what can only be described as a school dinner, closer to cold than warm, let alone hot.P&O have taken portion control and penny pinching to a whole new level. My dinner would comfortably fit on a side plate. You had to ask for things such as horseradish sauce for the beef, by the time it arrived all doubt was dispelled and your dinner was now fully cold. Desert was a very small portion of Apple strusel and custard, and, not in the least bit surprising, was one degree warmer than clap cold!My wife ordered cheese and biscuits, with some ‘extra’ grapes. What arrived was a digestive biscuit, a cream cracker and half a broken water biscuit. The cheese was clearly pieces left over from the lunchtime buffet, hard and discolouring around the edges. She was however grateful to receive 3 grapes, presumably the third one was the extra one. This theme continued throughout the cruise. The inclusive restaurants are simply miniature carveries serving very small portions of carved meats and veg, one potatoe, one carrot, every night with an alternative fish dish or two staples of Steak or Chicken breast which are served every night.﻿We tried the extra cost venues, Sindhu, I ordered a Lamb Bhuna and was told the chef wouldn’t recommend that because the lamb was so fatty! I kid you not.Beachhouse, £9.50 cover charge to eat in the Horizon buffet area with food of the same standard as lunchtimes, poor!Keel and Cow, average at very best and you’re eating in the packed Atrium.The Horizon buffet area is a mass bun fight at all times, no trays (apparently to reduce queuing) so people making numerous trips for different things that would have fit on a tray.These issues simply don’t happen in Club dining onboard the other P&O ships where quality and service far exceed the standards on display here and they too have already been pared back to the bone many years ago.

Wanting to travel with them again I tried twice yesterday to pay for a Fjords cruise. Your request was not processed, try again later. Rang the bank. Yes they had authorised the payment.Tried the telephone number given. Nobody answering so gave up. If its this hard to book a ticket is it worth even cruising with them again. The reviews are off-putting enough but the fact they are not bothering to respond to anyone caps it all.

I tried to book using a friends and family discount code, no option online so tried to call them.  They clearly do not have enough staff or phones ignored as I waited on 3 occasions for over 20 minutes with no answer, also they didn’t reply to numerous messages to contact me, so in the end gave up and booked without the code!Maybe this should have been a warning sign about what was to follow.Our cruise was a single port stop to Amsterdam, the night before after the phone lines were shut or about to they decided to inform us that the cruise was now going to Cherbourg and Le Havre instead! Neither of which having great appeal to us as we have seen both before.  I did some research and established shipping was informed 3 days previous of the port closure, so that is a long duration between being told and informing passengers.  One would suspect a ploy to avoid to many people cancelling, many passengers were turning up on the morning to embark on only then learning of the changes.Since we had booked time off and all our travel logistics around this cruise we decided to continue with it, we were offered a £50pp on board spend, quite poor.  As we all know all purchases on board have an incredible mark-up so they were not really giving us £50 off the trip.  With the reduced port fees for the alternative ports and less fuel I cannot see P&O out of pocket, in fact many would argue they made more profit out of us, especially those staying on board the days in port.Anyway, time to enjoy our cruise…   so we thought.First of all the staff onboard we found to be fantastic and attentive.  The food was also excellent and on par if not better than other cruises we have been on.  Pools and Hot Tubs were well maintained and plenty of towels available.We did however have lots of issues with the toilet in our room not flushing, we reported problem to be told it was common and many effected by this and someone was working on it.   Not great as we had to use toilets elsewhere and quite a walk from our room. I happened across two days of the four-day cruise!  Again, no offer of moving room or compensation.On day three the wifi have out pretty much from 1am through to 5pm, the only means we had to communicate with our friends on board as we were out of mobile signal range, also we have elderly parents who we wanted to have contact with.  I appreciate the complexities of the wifi on board via satellite, this appeared an equipment issue as not dropping out but full service unavailable.  It was only fixed when we reached port and I presume an engineer could board.  Okay these things happen, but at £80 something paid for a wifi connection I would have expected the offer of some to re-imbursed, but this was not offered.Apart from the very good service from the team on board the cruise and the running of left a lot to be desired.  The focus from customer satisfaction to creating enormous profit has clearly shifted for this company to the worse in our option.  The company believe by their vison statement to be delivering unmatched joyful vacations for their guests and always exceeding their expectations.  On this cruise they failed miserably. One part of the statement is true though – always driving outstanding shareholder value! Just as a word of warning, we also heard many guests at the reception desk (while queuing numerous times to report issues) disputing double charging for services and other billing issues.

Before check in I asked to be moved but she refused and a password was set so no other staff could move me. I knew the room was dire as I was put in there once before. I asked several staff to move me but they were unable and some lied on her behalf saying no availabilty. My daughter rang as a potential guest inquiring about availability and was told that in fact 10 rooms were available! I sat in my car until 12.45am trying to find another hotel but reluctantly had to check in as a last resort. The mattress was soiled, dead insects on the wall and skirting, ripped carpet, dust hanging off the bedside light, very low bed being 2 singles not joined together properly, generally dirty and it smelt. How cruel of this area manager to devalue a customer in such a way not to assist when all the time she could have. I doubt she would sleep in that filth. She knew I was homeless from a water disaster but she chose to be unkind. All other staff were pleasant but she is ruining their reputation with her manipulation and control. They were instructed to lie to me saying there were no other rooms available. One member of staff said shall I see if you can move to one of our other Premier Inns? It was late at night but she did not know how to do that anyway. I confronted Becky the next morning requesting a change of room and she complained about extra housekeeping labour. I told her my insurance company asked me to get checked out and needed her name. She tricked me into saying ask them to ring her direct and she will see what she can do. It was in the power of her hand to do something all the way along but she refused. Anyway I left the hotel for an appointment and my insurance company rang to sort it out. Unfortunately she lied again saying I had left belongings in the room and I had the key card. This was her way of blocking me staying and maintaining control as no change of rooms could then take place. It was a complete lie as trust me, I was never going back to that ghastly room. She should be sacked for abusing her position. There is no excuse for what she did. I have photos of every dirty thing in that room. I want my Insurance company refunded. By the way, please do not expect any loyalty as I had been there for months, but thousands of pounds later, you get treated with disrespect. Nobody should be forced to take a dirty room and one that was not even booked in the first place. I really hope that CEO Dominic Paul and MD Simon Jones reads this. I will ensure the photos will be circulated as that is my evidence of the truth! Unfortunately I will have to post them through another source. Message to disabled guests - please do not book Room 1 (Ringwood) as you deserve better.

So no family room available and nothing super about any of it. Eventually given two separate standard rooms after about half an hour's carry on at reception, because we just needed to get some sleep... But had to share a bed with a crying toddler, who constantly wanted to go find her dad in his room. We chose a room with two beds for a reason, so thanks for the three or so hours' sleep, fantastic 👍The room we were given was anything but the quieter room we booked and really needed at the time (Super Rooms are on the hotel's quietest floor apparently - didn't get the chance to find out if this even existed). We faced the motorway which was noisy as anything, sirens going at all hours. All this the night before my husband and I had another 3 hour car journey and event we had to attend, and I was lucky to stay awake for. Oh, and this is the second Travelodge hotel to pull this stunt on us in 10 months. It's actually making me worried every time we travel in case we get to the hotel and we don't have a room, even if we've already paid for it, because that clearly means nothing to Travelodge!  I'd sent my husband in first to make sure our room was free because I had a gut feeling something was going to be wrong. All this the night before my birthday, so I started off the next day tired and in a foul mood, because apparently some stupid automated system thought we'd be happy to arrive to no room, and then be okay with two separate rooms and a shared bed - which reception struggled to even accommodate, we were lucky to get them it would seem. The alternative was to be packed off to another hotel at 10pm. Absolutely furious at them. Computer systems are set up by actual people, with decisions made to allow it to double book, so someone somewhere is at fault. As far as the initial booking is concerned, you must pay in advance, and you have to pay more for a flexible rate - so if you don't, you can't cancel the room yourself... but they can decide they don't actually have a room for you, that you've already paid for, when you arrive? 🤔 Does someone care to explain how that works please? I've emailed to complain, expecting to receive what is clearly the Travelodge textbook spiel of ""Should a hotel not be able to accommodate a guest's booking, we have procedures in place with the assistance of our Booking Support Team to make sure that a suitable alternative is arranged and  when in another hotel, any travel expenses are covered"". But haven't even had that response, it's just gone ignored! Customers are clearly just a number to this company, as long as they're getting the business and your money ahead of your stay.

I entered and Pranali who came to the desk served two people for some time before myself although she knew I was first. MY COMPLAINT STARTSMy daughter (10) and I had breakfast, I needed to use the loo and asked Pranali to use the loo. She told me where the toilets were, fully well knowing It not only needed a card but also a code to enter. She gave me a card which seemed to work first time, but the door was locked with the code that she hadn't given me. On returning to reception twice, she then informed me of the code. I still tried twice, the code lock worked but card key didn't. After going back to reception to her, she insisted it would work. Please remember that she is the face of Travelodge and service should be helpful and kind. After my last insistent return she came, did open the door and was very rude with her conduct and mannerisms. I told her on my return not to speak to me as such and to have respect for her conduct and professionalism. She started arguing with me. Of course within this time I am worried abput leaving my daughter alone and having to converse with rude staff whilst bursting to go to the loo. She refused at first to give her name and her conduct needs to be viewed on your video cameras. When she gave her name and asked to spell it, she said it so fast several times with a view of confusing me. Please listen. I stayed at this hotel for nearly two weeks back in 2016/17 and this certainly wasn't the conduct or mature of the staff. Please accept my formal complaint and I want someone to view and listen to the start to finish of my sub-standard and poor conduct of your staff. You can view my file and see that every year basically I stay with Travelodge for a week.or two. If you condone this kind of behaviour, my business will not be with your business anymore. There is certainly a training issue here. Please see attachments. I wait for someone to view the videos of my encounter.

Our flights home were cancelled a few hours before we were due to go home due to the signalling issues over the UK. Whilst the issue was out of easyJet’s control how they deal with situations and help families resolve issues is totally within their control! We received no notification our flight was cancelled and only knew cause we had heard about the issues back home in the UK so were checking our flight ourselves! When we realised it was cancelled I called easyJet straight away to see what we do! Bearing in mind I have 2 children under the age of 12! The “customer service” on the phone was diabolical to say the least! Clearly reading from a script and repeating sorry ma’am I have given you all the options available! Apart from there was no options, our flights were moved to two days later, not ideal but fine, however nothing about helping us with somewhere to stay until then! After going round in circles for 45 minutes I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager as I wasn’t happy with how the situation was being handled and wasn’t willing to get off the phone and wait “90 minutes” for someone to call me back with hotel details! Booking a hotel takes minutes and can be done whilst on the phone, I knew I would never get back through due to how busy they would be! Despite asking many times and explaining my children were sat on the floor outside Disneyland they would not put me through to anyone senior and just said I would get a call back within 48-72 hours, which is a joke! After realising we weren’t going to get anywhere I agreed for them to sort the hotel and get back to me within 90 minutes with the details, in the mean time we just had to wait as we had checked out of our hotel that morning! That was 5 days ago and I have never heard from easyJet again! They never confirmed my rearranged flights, never sorted out a hotel for my family and have not responded to my emails, Facebook posts, Private messages and you can’t get through on the phone! So as far as they are aware my children had to sleep on the floor for two days and they haven’t even had the decency to respond to any of my complaints! We were not the only family stuck outside Disney with this issue, there were many families, all of which we were easyJet and having the exact same issue! They might be cheap, but it’s not worth the risk that if something goes wrong they won’t be there to help you!

My tracking app showed it had moved to three different locations in Gatwick. I contacted Easyjet head office again. A lady there told me that if the device had not been handed in, I should report it as stolen to the police.Posts by other travellers who had failed to recover items left on board Easyjet planes were not encouraging.

We had to book new flights out of our own pocket from bristol to Paris, then Paris to Palermo. So, we take off from Paris relived and could see the light at the end of the tunnel. Captain comes on microphone 30 mins into the flight. “We are sorry but we are turning back to Paris due to the safety checks certificate not being signed off” blah blah blah. So basically we are stuck in Paris after our safety being put a risk and being put up in the air on an illegal chartered plane. You could not make this up  I can’t begin to explain all my experiences with this airline but I’ll have a go. 2017 Turkey, flight cancelled as we were supposed to board.  Not 1 staff on site! disabled people in wheelchairs and young babies in the line. Had to wait 5 hours to be told that we needed to make our own way home. Thompsons arranged for their passengers to be transferred to a hotel whilst we were left for dead. 2 hours later wee were told we could go to the same hotel but when we got there Thompsons arranged a buffet for their passengers we were told we would have to pay. They then kicked us out the next morning at 8am, whilst Thompsons passengers were having breakfast. We were transferred back to the air port and told to wait…..10 hours later we were told to make our own way home again. Great service! Last year flight cancelled 5 hours before a 6am flight from bristol to Italy, my Italian partner was distraught not seeing her family since the Covid restrictions..we found  a flight from London leaving at 10am and managed to find a taxi at 2am to take us…a clapped Citroen Berlungo turned up and the driver (foreign) had no idea he was having to go to Gatwick. Any way he proceeded to drive at 90mph swerving across lanes whilst texting and having a 2yo with us in the car, and I had to threaten him if he carried on….(I was in no mood) the faulty towers experience proceeded to excel its self when he managed to get a puncture after taking a wrong turn. 70mph blow out on the m4. I was left having to help him repair the puncture with 90mins spare in the hard shoulder with lorries flying past our heads. This is not easy jets fault but let’s face it it kind of was! This year there’s another issue again!! Yes again! There’s been flight cancellations to Catania and they have cancelled most of their flights but are still telling us ours looks like it’s going ahead. All the other airlines have gave passengers plenty of notice to find another solution but here we are biting our nails wondering 15hours before the flight if they are about to screw us over again. Let’s find out I have Zero faith in this company. Class Action lawsuit will be coming their way one day soonEDIT…..late last night Flight cancelled!!!!! 5 times I called Sleazy jet and they would not give me any info or let me change my flight without a charge of hundreds of pounds effectively leaving us with no options.

My husband uses an Oxygen machine and there are forms to be completed and sent to Virgin plus an application has to be made to a company - Oxygen to Go, to get approval for the make of machine and the batteries. Oxygen to go replied very quickly and we called them and were assured the approval info had been sent to both Virgin and Delta (for our internal flight). Virgin’s website is not clear as to how to send them all the info they need. We emailed the Special Assistance Team several times, because you cannot phone them for advice, but got no replies so decided to email the medical forms, mask exemption letter, application to Oxygen to Go and their approval response. We also sent everything by signed for Royal Mail. As flight dates got closer with still no reply to advise us it was ok to bring the oxygen machine on board, we called customer services. They too were concerned about lack of action from the Special Assistance team but said they cannot phone them . They sent them another email. Another week went by but no reply. We called customer services again but they couldn’t help except to send another email. A few days before our flight I sent another email to the Special Assistance team begging them to contact us as by now my husband was becoming I’ll at the stress of it all and very worried that he might not be able to use oxygen on the flights. Hurrah, we got a phone call and we’re assured that everything was in place and that both Virgin and Delta had been informed about the machine for outward and return flights. Our outward journey went without further incident and the flight crew were excellent. On the morning of our return flights we woke to discover an email from Virgin that our internal Delta flight had been cancelled but that we shouldn’t worry as they were looking into it and were aware we also had another flight so they would be looking at everything. They promised they would get back to us very soon. That email had arrived at 3am and this was at 8am. We should have left for our original flight at 9am so we’re worried that we had not had an update. Tried to call Virgin but usual message and on hold. After an hour of waiting we were panicking. There was no email and nothing updated on Virgin website so we went onto the Delta sight to see that we’d been put on another Atlanta flight 2 hours after the cancelled one. This left us two hours short on the layover but we were relieved about having a flight given the complications of having to have a covid test before departure - this would have been out of time if we were delayed another day. We checked in at the airport, given boarding cards and checked our luggage. We went to the departure gate and at boarding time the machine would not accept our boarding cards. We were told our seats had been cancelled and staff were unsure if that meant our Virgin flight from Atlanta also. They too could not get through to Virgin so couldn’t check if our long haul flight was still available. We just had to take the chance and travel to Atlanta (fortunately there were still seats for us to do that). The stress was unbelievable. In Atlanta it was a huge rush to get to the Virgin gate and my husband can’t hurry. At the gate there was a massive queue as everyone had their covid documents checked yet again. Finally we were told our seats on that flight had not been cancelled. Today is 2 days after getting home and we have yet to receive an email from Virgin about them sorting nee flights for us. I have to say that the customer services, and particularly the supposed Special Assistance team leaves a huge amount to be desired. After so long living with the Pandemic I find it hard to believe that they have not yet got their act together. I have done a review received by email but am not holding my breath for any follow up from Virgin. I am appalled and do not think I will be using Virgin Atlantic again.

I was told the booking had been provisionally made so the price was locked in. The team in question took around 6 weeks to contact me.

The aircraft looked fairly new and inside, the clean looking cabin set a positive tone to the mood, before our long journey. But most importantly, for a long flight of over 9 hours, we were looking forward to a professional and caring in-flight service. In our case, the in-flight cabin service turned out to be excellent, thanks to the attending crew taking care of the passengers. In this context, a special word of appreciation and thanks goes out to the two members of the cabin crew, Resham Gupta and Tarunjeet Midha. Throughout the course of the fight, they were on their toes and regularly checking up if we required anything.  Night flights often take the smile off the face of the serving crew, but in the case of these two aforementioned crew members, that was not the case and they were extremely polite.

The Ryanair app was insufficient because the gate was changed and despite constantly refreshing the page, and being signed into the airport WiFi, it was just buffering. A woman approached me, a fellow passenger, and asked if I was going to EMA and I said yes, and she informed me of the gate number. I told her the app wasn’t working and she said hers did that too and someone told her the number of the gate. After an agonising 3.5-hour wait, Ryanair staff sent us down the stairs, from the gate to the runway, to board the plane but then we were trapped in a locked stairwell for at least 20mins. I was by the locked door, with staff the other side of it who ignored us. It was so hot, no air, and because I’d already spent 6 hours in the airport and I have ADHD, I was majorly overstimulated to the point of meltdown. As there’s seemingly nowhere to go for people with ADHD, autistic people, or just people that need quiet to calm their anxiety. Don’t ever send passengers down a locked stairwell and say to move closer together to get more people in and then have us wait whilst people are still getting off the plane we are about to board. Wait until the plane is ready! I began having an anxiety attack in the stairwell; heart racing; overheating; sweating; tears welling up; hands shaking and experiencing a tension headache. I was listening to an EMDR music playlist for the whole 6 hours and doing what I could to regulate my nervous system and alleviate the stress worsened by my ADHD. However, the lack of organisation between the gate and people on the ground, treating us like cattle, sent me over the edge. We were finally let outside where we had to wait a further 10 minutes or so, but the relief of being outside made my tears roll and I couldn’t contain them any longer. A member of staff asked if I was ok, and I couldn’t really speak because my brain was so overwhelmed and not functioning properly. The passenger, stood next to me, said to her, “I think this has just made a lot of people very anxious.” Personally, I’m not an anxious flyer, I usually enjoy it but I couldn’t get my words out so I just said, ‘it’s being trapped’ and the staff member said, “aw, you should’ve said I would have opened the door for you.”. Who would I have asked??? There were no staff on the stairwell and the cabin crew in front of the doors all had their backs to us and even when the looked at us they didn’t acknowledge us at all. The staff member then said, “are you travelling together?” to me and the woman next to me and struggling to speak I said, “I’m alone” and she said, “well it won’t be long now.”  Then I boarded the plane, and no-one checked my boarding pass, even though I had it ready and held it out with my passport to be checked. They let me walk down from the front to row 28 to discover for myself that my assigned seat didn’t exist because the aircraft had been changed from the original flight. This could’ve been avoided if tickets were checked at the door, especially as the cabin crew knew the aircraft was different to the original one for the flight. I had to move around from seat to seat, like a pinball in an aeroplane-shaped pin ball machine; hot, sweaty, fatigued and overstimulated, moving my luggage around with me in the tight cabin until finally I got a spare seat, and I quietly cried the whole flight home. Then once I finally got home to Nottingham, I received a text from Ryanair at 23:53 apologising for the delay and giving me a complimentary €4 to spend at selected airport food vendors at Dublin airport. Too little, too late. I then saw an email that was sent at 21:02 offering passengers the option to swap to a different Ryanair flight, to a different part of England. What a useless offer, by the time I got to the nearest airport to EMA, which would be Birmingham, and then had to pay for another means of travel to Nottingham it would cost me more and get me there around the same time as waiting for my delayed flight to EMA. Budget travel should not mean negligent travel.

The Ryanair app was insufficient because the gate was changed and despite constantly refreshing the page, and being signed into the airport WiFi, it was just buffering. A woman approached me, a fellow passenger, and asked if I was going to EMA and I said yes, and she informed me of the gate number. I told her the app wasn’t working and she said hers did that too and someone told her the number of the gate. After an agonising 3.5-hour wait, Ryanair staff sent us down the stairs, from the gate to the runway, to board the plane but then we were trapped in a locked stairwell for at least 20mins. I was by the locked door, with staff the other side of it who ignored us. It was so hot, no air, and because I’d already spent 6 hours in the airport and I have ADHD, I was majorly overstimulated to the point of meltdown. As there’s seemingly nowhere to go for people with ADHD, autistic people, or just people that need quiet to calm their anxiety. Don’t ever send passengers down a locked stairwell and say to move closer together to get more people in and then have us wait whilst people are still getting off the plane we are about to board. Wait until the plane is ready! I began having an anxiety attack in the stairwell; heart racing; overheating; sweating; tears welling up; hands shaking and experiencing a tension headache. I was listening to an EMDR music playlist for the whole 6 hours and doing what I could to regulate my nervous system and alleviate the stress worsened by my ADHD. However, the lack of organisation between the gate and people on the ground, treating us like cattle, sent me over the edge. We were finally let outside where we had to wait a further 10 minutes or so, but the relief of being outside made my tears roll and I couldn’t contain them any longer. A member of staff asked if I was ok, and I couldn’t really speak because my brain was so overwhelmed and not functioning properly. The passenger, stood next to me, said to her, “I think this has just made a lot of people very anxious.” Personally, I’m not an anxious flyer, I usually enjoy it but I couldn’t get my words out so I just said, ‘it’s being trapped’ and the staff member said, “aw, you should’ve said I would have opened the door for you.”. Who would I have asked??? There were no staff on the stairwell and the cabin crew in front of the doors all had their backs to us and even when the looked at us they didn’t acknowledge us at all. The staff member then said, “are you travelling together?” to me and the woman next to me and struggling to speak I said, “I’m alone” and she said, “well it won’t be long now.”  Then I boarded the plane, and no-one checked my boarding pass, even though I had it ready and held it out with my passport to be checked. They let me walk down from the front to row 28 to discover for myself that my assigned seat didn’t exist because the aircraft had been changed from the original flight. This could’ve been avoided if tickets were checked at the door, especially as the cabin crew knew the aircraft was different to the original one for the flight. I had to move around from seat to seat, like a pinball in an aeroplane-shaped pin ball machine; hot, sweaty, fatigued and overstimulated, moving my luggage around with me in the tight cabin until finally I got a spare seat, and I quietly cried the whole flight home. Then once I finally got home to Nottingham, I received a text from Ryanair at 23:53 apologising for the delay and giving me a complimentary €4 to spend at selected airport food vendors at Dublin airport. Too little, too late. I then saw an email that was sent at 21:02 offering passengers the option to swap to a different Ryanair flight, to a different part of England. What a useless offer, by the time I got to the nearest airport to EMA, which would be Birmingham, and then had to pay for another means of travel to Nottingham it would cost me more and get me there around the same time as waiting for my delayed flight to EMA.

The flight was scheduled at 08:15 am. We drove from Southampton and due to unforeseen stops (my wife being in her first trimester of pregnancy of our first baby), we arrived at the check-in counter at 05:55am. I explained to them that their app has been malfunctioning and I have been trying to check in since yesterday and was not able to. I tried to look at the FAQs which weren't any help and tried to contact customer service, no answer, nada, nil, zip, nothing at all, no response. The staff on the check-in counter was rude and brushed my concern off as if it was nothing. We had to pay 55 Euros each to check in simply because their app was cr*p. What made this whole trip worse was the 6+ hour delay for a 1-hour flight. No clear information. Text says one thing, staff says another, screen near the gate says still another. At first, they said 30-minute delay, then 1 hour, then 2 hours. When they finally said it will only take about 15-minute before they let us board, we all stood up and started lining up but that was another 1 hour wait. When they finally allowed us to enter the gate, they made us wait in a cramped space where we could all smell each other's sweat. My pregnant wife almost fainted/collapsed at this point. When we were finally in the plane, we thought finally this is it, we're gonna leave, they made us wait another hour+ inside the plane! The worst part in all these was the casual behaviour of the staff as if nothing was happening. We were all hungry and it wasn't even until we've asked for a cup of water that they gave one.

You guessed it right, it was a predictable disaster and left me feline like a scared, lonely kitten on a highway at night.So, after exploring my options for my family holiday and with Ryanair holding 600 of my hard-earned shekels, I had no choice, I had to opt again for Ryanair (though 480 euros more expensive than the original flight), I decided to book with them again. I swear, applying the voucher code was like solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded in a bowl of Strawberry blancmange. To my amazement, it worked! Or so I thought...When I used Apple Pay to seal the deal, it blatantly ignored my voucher, like my kids ignore their chores, and charged me the full whack!

But alas, my complaint was as welcome as a fart on a plane. It was ""miscategorised"" and therefore unacceptable and rejected like a passenger at the Ryanair gate with no passport (despite a passport not being legally required and not used by other airlines).I relayed this ordeal to customer service again, who promised me a response in 14 days.

The rep repeated the mantra - lodge a complaint, wait 14 days, rinse, and repeat. At this point, I reckon Kafka would struggle to weave a tale as absurd as my experience with Ryanair's customer service.

At first, they said 30-minute delay, then 1 hour, then 2 hours. When they finally said it will only take about 15-minute before they let us board, we all stood up and started lining up but that was another 1 hour wait.

You guessed it right, it was a predictable disaster and left me feline like a scared, lonely kitten on a highway at night.So, after exploring my options for my family holiday and with Ryanair holding 600 of my hard-earned shekels, I had no choice, I had to opt again for Ryanair (though 480 euros more expensive than the original flight), I decided to book with them again. I swear, applying the voucher code was like solving a Rubik's cube blindfolded in a bowl of Strawberry blancmange. To my amazement, it worked! Or so I thought...When I used Apple Pay to seal the deal, it blatantly ignored my voucher, like my kids ignore their chores, and charged me the full whack!

At this point, I reckon Kafka would struggle to weave a tale as absurd as my experience with Ryanair's customer service.

Booked a ticket to go from Bulgaria to Bristol for Christmas back in November 2020 when travelling was still allowed. My outbound flight from Bristol was cancelled due to official ban for British citizens to enter the country and so I couldn't use my return ticket with Ryanair. They refused to issue a refund or give me a voucher. I paid £172.92 for this flight and extra £28,69 to change the date to March 27th (ref ZEB8XX). This time they cancelled this flight officially and so I was given the chance to get a refund. Filled out and submitted my request and was asked to confirm 1000 times that it was a cash refund I wanted, not voucher and I was assured that money will be refunded to the card I used to make that payment within 7 days. After 19 days there was nothing and then an email from their customer service that they've changed the voucher into cash payment (I never requested a voucher in the first place).

United informed me that I was 100% correct and Are Lingus needed to re issue the ticket.  United told me they had notified Aer Lingus in November that this particular leg of the journey had been cancelled.

From our view of the aircraft there was obviously no possibility that the flight would leave and yet no Aer Lingus staff were present to give help or guidance. We eventually received a text message saying we had been rescheduled for a flight two days later, after already being called to the gate for boarding. This was unacceptable and we contacted our Travel Agent who managed to get us on a Dublin to Orlando flight the following day. This meant flying to Dublin and spending the night in a hotel. The Manchester to Dublin flight could only accommodate seven of the party so three people (including two small children) had to taxi to Birmingham airport to catch a Birmingham to Dublin flight. See flight details below Flight EI3329 Manchester - Dublin Dep: 20:55 x 7 Flight E1277 :Birmingham to Dublin Dep: 21:30…. X 3 We all had significant extra food and drink costs in the airport due to the delay, having had to stay in the airport from 07.30 until our above flights to Dublin at which also departed behind schedule.The departure from Dublin was again delayed and then we had to sit on the tarmac at Orlando for an hour because a plane was still in the gate.When we finally got off the plane we were further delayed by over three hours because of an existing problem with the baggage handling system. No Aer Lingus or indeed any staff were there to offer assistance. The whole Terminal C experience was a disaster with a complete lack of help.

Aer Lingus told us we were definitely booked with United, which was ‘a direct flight to Manchester’. They sent us back to TC. United again reiterated we had no such booking, and that there were no flights direct to Manchester that day or the next day. So a blatant lie by Aer Lingus.

Aer Lingus staff in Manchester said our bags were checked through to Dallas, however, on arrival in Orlando, three messages on the tanoy saying Aer Lingus passengers must collect bags and take to baggage transfer. This we did, we missed our connection as the EI35 flight was late, finally made it to Dallas 24 hours later...but our three brand new bright blue samsonites didn't make it. First week of holiday spent on calls, and trying to secure replacement medication. Wife emotional wreck, kids upset. 65 phone calls, happy to share screenshots, got through 3 times (they hang up on you almost every time), and apparently the bags are in Dallas and with the delivery company. Funny thing is, this is BS, baggage services for British Airways and American (who do answer the phone)  can't see the bags at all on the WorldTracer system.

11038,Aer Lingus,https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.aerlingus.com,1.6,1327,16,united kingdom,True,2022-07-08,1,"Booked a flight from Hamburg to Dublin which was cancelled at 11 at night before the flight. Being relatively close to the airport with a 15 minute drive excluding harsh traffic conditions we were to leave at 7.30 in the morning to be on time for their recommendation of arriving 2.5 hours before your flight. No email arrived, just a simple SMS with a slightly incorrect flight reference number. I found this suspicious so I proceeded to be put on hold for an hour trying to get through to their customer service line. It took a total of an hour and a half before they hung up on me. I tried again and they picked up after 54 minutes. We were asked if we would like to replace our flight and we said yes, we need the quickest one possible as my partner had an important appointment to do with his health and I needed to work as I work with my self employed family who had contracted covid, disabling them from making any money. She said the only available flight was on a Sunday. Our original flight was on the Wednesday prior. I found this extremely unprofessional as I had to wait almost 2.5 hours to organise my own flight home after the SMS stated “We are currently making every effort to find an alternative flight for you. If our team has secured alternative travel, you will shortly receive another SMS.” This SMS was never received causing me two and a half hours of anxiety and discomfort as I grasped to find a way home. While on the line and excepting this flight on Sunday, the customer care person on the other line requested that I be patient after she put me on hold. Assuming she would come back on the line to confirm details with me I waited for a short five minutes until she ended the call without warning. I called again waiting an hour to be put through to another aerlingus customer care worker. I told her what had happened and she said the new flight was on record. This was just about acceptable, but with no confirmation and an anxiety driven couple of hours not knowing if we would be compensated for our overly expensive flight (which could be excusable by covid and the fact it was Summer) or even have a way home, it was clear this airline was a joke.  I accepted the unprofessional and unorganised nature already swearing to myself that I would never fly with them again. Believing this was the worst of our struggles is laughable. We managed to book a flight for the Friday instead, waiting a staggering 1 hour and 45 minutes to check our bags in. We had 35 minutes to get to our flight which seemed impossible with the never ending flood of unorganised lines going into security which began at three entrance to the airport in Terminal 2. The security did a better job then the aerlingus staff with an undoubtly much more important job which is to secure the safety of the passengers. We were through the line in 25 minutes which is unbelievable considering it’s length. We ran as fast as we could from security to our gate where there was floods of people rushing, panicking and waiting to get onto the flight. No line in sight, just a very large crowd of unhappy passengers. Slightly annoyed, we were just happy to have made it through the unnecessary questioning and unfriendliness of the aerlingus check in desk. No one came to the boarding desk for almost twenty minutes. When they did, we recognised it was the same two lonely workers who had been at the check in desk. Just two workers in the whole airport. Where were these two workers when we had arrived to the airport on wednesday morning looking for answers? Finally we go onto the plane, uncomfortable, irritable and hungry as we hadn’t had time to even pick up a quick snack through all the chaos. When the food trolly came along with overpriced terrible quality food I decided I would purchase something because I was so uncomfortable. Card only. This was extremely inconvenient as my card wasn’t working due to uncontrollable problems in the bank. Once arriving in Dublin, extremely annoyed with my partner, we decided we would eat something once we had our bags retrieved from baggage claim. We waited from when the belts started moving until the notice board read that the last bag had been delivered. At least 75% of the customers waiting hadn’t received their luggage. We thought there might be sum mistake as one lost bag is somewhat excusable on a good airline, but this many people waiting in crowds around the aerlingus desk from the same terrible flight? We filled out a form, unsure what to do. The unfriendly staff said that they couldn’t help us. We were anxious, uncomfortable and stressed as we were going to miss our bus. Twenty minutes later a man told us to line up again, and notified us the rest of the bags would be put on the luggage belt.

I knew it, my family knew it, but when it happens nobody is really prepared. My mom made the call and it was time. Time to say our farewells to the man who is my father. He came into my life when I was seven years old. He swept my mom off her feet and took us into his heart without hesitation. So, ja he is my father, my dad, my confidante my partner in crime. He wasn’t perfect, but he had vision. For those who knew him, that means something. I live in Germany, so I booked my flight to travel home, to say goodbye to the man who taught me just about everything. I booked a flight connecting in Dublin. As I was disembarking the the Aer Lingus flight EI 693, I took a quick glance at my phone and saw the message „he died“. I must have let out a loud gasp, because the attentive flight attendant immediately asked „did something happen?“ I begann to cry uncontrollably. And it was at this point, as I lost all sense of where I was and what I needed to do that the Aer Lingus staff jumped into action. The on-board crew immediately knew that I needed support and contacted an agent to guide me through the entire process up to boarding my connecting flight. As I was waiting for the agent at least one person was with me the whole time, comforting me in the most empathetic and kind manner possible. When the agent arrived, he was also kind, offered me water, distracted me with really truly pleasant conversation and helped me locate a usb port to charge my phone, in order to stay in contact with my family. While I was waiting for my connecting flight EI 121 the manager introduced himself and assured me that I needn’t worry about boarding time and cuing, that he would personally bring me to the gate. He also asked the open-ended question, if I needed anything else, I was already completely amazed by the service, that I honestly couldn’t imagine requesting anything else. He then ensured that the flight crew on my connecting flight were aware of my situation and will take care of me. Every single person introduced themselves on a a first name basis.

Aer Lingus lost my baggage on a flight from Manchester to Dublin 5 days ago. Very annoying as it had all my Christmas presents for my family and a birthday present too; but it happens. My issue is the complete incompetence and poor communication since losing my baggage. I put in the details of my permanent address, contact numbers, temporary address in Ireland and when I was flying back to UK. No updates for 48 hours except a courtesy call to my mum in Ireland who I'd included as a secondary contact to say they'd not found it. At that point, we asked if they could call me directly from now on as they had my details as the primary contact, they did not.After a few days in Ireland, I fly back to Manchester and when I arrive home my mum texts me to say they've found the bag and she's told them to call me. They don't call me, so when I eventually get through to them myself, I find out it's been found in Manchester but put on a flight back to Dublin and they can't pull it off.As annoying as this was, I then agreed with their baggage tracing department that the baggage should just get delivered to my temporary address in Ireland as it's already flying to Dublin. And that way at least my family get their presents in time for Christmas. They assure me this is fine and they've updated the record to reflect this. I call back in the evening to double check this is still the case as the online tracer is now showing the baggage being routed back to Manchester. They assure me that this is an error and my baggage will get delivered to my family at the temporary address in Ireland I shared with them.Low and behold, I called them again yesterday and the baggage is now on a flight back to Manchester. I then get an email from their customer service team in the evening telling me that they don't offer compensation and according to their records my baggage has been delivered. My baggage still hasn't been delivered. I've no confidence in anything they're telling me so who knows when or if it will arrive. And they're now suggesting they won't even compensate me beyond any receipts that I've kept for essential items I bought to see me through the days I spent in Ireland with no baggage. So no compensation to cover the costs I paid to book baggage on the flights which never arrived or the costs I'm going to incur posting the presents back to Ireland if and when my baggage is finally delivered back to me. Let alone compensation for the inconvenience and unnecessary stress caused.It's beyond a joke, it has made Christmas and the time I spent in Ireland more stressful than it needed to be.

This is my reply following a response from TripAdvisor/Holiday Lettings. My original review is below this:MY RESPONSE TO: Oliver - Tripadvisor Rentals SupportIt’s a refreshing change to get such a prompt response from you. It’s a shame that it takes my Trustpilot negative review to motivate you to respond. It’s also a shame that in the recent telephone conversation with the last operator of 3 separate calls,  I had the misfortune of being subjected to, Stefanie, didn’t see fit to refer my UNRESOLVED complaints and certainly didn’t ‘help me in anyway’. I am guessing this person was based in a French territory, judging by her name and accent. Instead, she chose to talk over me and ignore my legitimate complaints. UK customer service is second to none. Keep it in the UK for UK customers please. Let’s start backing Britain!About our commission, you claim we pay a 3% (excl. VAT) fee per booking. MY RESPONSEI will correct your claim. For example: an extra night, we charged £120. Your charges to the customer were £137.00 and to us £4.00. That makes a TOTAL CHARGE by Tripadvisor of £21 or 17.5%. This is typical of the charges made for all bookings. 17.5% total chargesAbout blocked messages to your guests, you state that, ‘we understand the inconvenience this may cause. In the interests of security, and to allow us to offer Payment Protection to travellers, contact details cannot be exchanged until a booking has been paid in full…’MY RESPONSEProviding contact details is not a problem for any other of the channels – only yours – something you changed without consultation a few years back. I have complained on many occasions, but these complaints have fallen on stoney ground. I can only assume that you don’t trust your owners, in which case I would be concerned that you advertise them on your channel! We also have automated systems to ensure that all guests receive relevant information as early as possible. It’s not possible to integrate that automation with your proprietary messaging system. You therefore are hindering us; we have to go on manual because of your selfish policy. This is both time consuming and expensive for us, but you clearly don’t care.If you don’t trust your owners, then don’t deal with them. Or put another way if you have no reason to believe we are being dishonest, treat us with some respect and allow us direct contact with guests, as we do with all other channels and once did with TripAdvisor.MY RESPONSE: CALL CENTRESThere is no need for an Indian call centre. I call during normal UK working hours. The only reason you lumber us with Indian call centres is to save you money, let’s be clear. If it was volume, you could increase your UK call centres. If you would sort out your messy and clunky booking edit, it would mean we wouldn’t need to deal with hapless representatives who have no clue what they are doing and dragging one problem, constantly putting me on hold while they seek advice for 2+ hours of my time, maybe you would get fewer and shorter calls. As you have acknowledged we have been with you for many years, I am very, well aware of your FAQS. None of them could resolve this issue you created. Hence a painful 3 long frustrating calls and over 2 hours of my time wasted. Your kind words are just that and I suspect aimed at an audience, not to help me. You have my details, you know who I am. I had to provide these to submit my review. If you really are genuine in wanting to resolve this, Oliver please call me, rather than virtue signal on this review site. This channel is one of the worst of the 5 that we use. They are intransigent and not at all customer friendly. They also charge one of the highest commissions.The call center is India based. From my experience over many years, they are not knowledgeable and script driven.Unlike other channels, they block any direct contact with your guest, until the guest has paid in full. This creates many issues.The invoicing is convoluted, not consistent and confusing.Editing bookings has limitations and usually ends up with a long, messy and convoluted phone call.

Admittedly they dropped the c. £250 upfront costs to advertise but this is way eclipsed by the new fees generated by an even vaguely busy property.

Staff  rude and given belongings back in a plastic bag. Felt humiliated other residents looking at us like we had done something wrong and then having to walk back across the pool with our belongings. There were no other sunbeds left for us to have. I understand that people go off for hours but we went to breakfast just before 10 and returned by 10.45 so our belongings should not have been removed. We reported our complaint to reception who said they would pass it on to Management and get back to us, which off course they didn't! We then spoke to our Jet 2 rep who was more interested in looking at what was going on behind us and we felt that she was trying to fob us off. She said she would speak to Management and get back to us. I had 1 missed call from her and then received a text from her on our last day just saying that she had tried to get hold of us and knew that it was our last day and that was that. There was nothing about the response to our complaint! I tried replying back to the text but it wouldn't let me as clearly it was blocked for replies. She could have easily let a message under our hotel room door but she didn't. Instead she waited until our last day to send the text.

As I said we have stayed before so where familiar with the layout but things may change in Covid times .We where greeted by a very pleasant young lady Hanna who checked us in then took our bags to our room which was a bit cramped but very clean and well decorated ,we then decided to have a pot of tea in the bar area ,but sadly a gentleman who I think was the manager who seemed very busy completely ignored us I must admit a quick smile and be with you in a minute take a seat would not of gone amiss .So as we where ignored we took a walk into town and took a late lunch tea at a nearby establishment . We also called into a local pub / bar ,well worth a visit as the decor is eclectic to say the least .

A quick walk around town and a snifter at the artisan brewery pub then back to the Sun and bed .

I went for the Cumberland full English very nice , my Partner asked for grilled tomatoes on toast it arrived one piece of toast and one grilled tomato I do think the portion could of been bigger maybe two pieces of toast and a choice of white or wholemeal and two tomatoes . We where given two slices of toast and preserves we asked for more toast but sadly it never arrived .
